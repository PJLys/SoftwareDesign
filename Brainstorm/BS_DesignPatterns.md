# Brainstorming Design Patterns
## Listing The Patterns
1. Strategy pattern
	- Extend functionality by adding features.
2. Observer pattern
	- Pub/Sub function.
3. Decorator
	- Extend functionality by wrapping the object with a same type object.
4. Singleton pattern
	- Make sure an object can only be initiated once.
5. Factory pattern
	- Seperate class that creates objects of the same family.
	- use when you can't anticipate object classes needed to be created.
6. Abstract Factory pattern
	- Creates a template for the factory classes you make.
7. Command pattern
	- Invoker sends commands, linked to a certain actuator who receives (un)execute task.
8. Adapter pattern
	- Adapter interfaces an adaptee to a client, who aren't compatible.
9. Facade pattern
	- Create a class that works as an interface between client and the system.
10. Proxy pattern
	- A proxy works as a middleman between a client and some sort of server
	- use when server requests are expensive (long delay, lots of data)
11. Iterator pattern
12. Composite pattern
13. State pattern
14. Template Method pattern
